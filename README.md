# About The Project

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. https://projecteuler.net/

This is the third problem in the series. The challenge was to find the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

So  far completed finding all  the factors of the number. To complete the project

# Built with:

The solution was built with Javascript ES6. Javascript concepts used:

while loops, conditional if statements, built in Math method

# What I learned:

I am learning how to write efficient code that uses less computing power.

The need to be creative in solving problems. I have initially written done this challenge using python and it took hours for the program to deliver a solution.
The steps taken to sole are commented in the program file
